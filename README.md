A library for generating color palette shades and overlay colors. Based on Google's Material Design color palette examples:
https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#

The library simply generates a full palette of colors, from a single color which is interpreted as the `Shade500` for the `MaterialColor`. From there you can easily grab any `Shade` from the `MaterialColor` and even the text color which will contrast nicely to the color. Great right?
